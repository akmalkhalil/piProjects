# hardwareProjects

I now have an arduino as well as a pi and am learning about more low level things, so this repository will contain my little project and experiments


## Projects

### LEDCube

I wanted to build an LED cube to try out demuxes and POV.

have tested so far with a 2x2 cube, once I can get more LEDs will create larger and use a demux

TODO: code some fun patterns

### FreeRTOS

I wanted to try learning more about RTOS
so I now have an arduino using the RTOS library and will try a few small test projects
