# Test using a demultiplexer with pi to control 2x ws281x LED strips
# The main purpose of this test isn't to see if it works, I reckon it will. it's more to see how it will work and how I will need to organise my code
# TODO: I should add to the testing functionality to test for use of Demux (up to maybe only 4 strips?)
